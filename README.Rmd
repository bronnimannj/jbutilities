# jbutilities

This package contains multiple functions I found or created through the years and may be useful to keep


## Installation

You can install the released version of jbutilities from [GITHUB](https://github.com/bronnimannj/jbutilities).



## Functions inside the package:

### check_format_df

This function verifies:

- The format of the table: data.table, data.frame or tibble?
- The names of the columns needed: only letters, integers or "_"
- The format of the columns: contains only factors and numeric columns
- Missing data per column
- Other strange values: "NaN", "NA", or +/- Inf

Then, it returns :

- For each boolean column the number of True or False values,
- For each categorical (factor) column the number of levels and the first 3 levels
- For each numerical column the min, mean, median, max, number of NAS, and the 1,10,25,75,90 and 99 quantiles.



### create_df_rd

This function creates a random dataset with some user inputs, without any NA nor Inf.

The inputs' formats need to be:

- "size": an integer
- "seed": an integer or NA
- "Numerics": NULL or a character vector of names of normally distributed numeric vectors
- "Booleans": NULL or a named (or not) vector of probabilities between 0 and 1 to have True
- "Categories": NULL or a list of factor variables, each element containing the levels as vector
